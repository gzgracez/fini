Fini is an application


Our application runs on Python 3. In order to run our application, you have to install the packages listed in requirements.txt: pip3 install -r requirements.txt. The environment configuration is located in export, so you can source the file to setup the configuration. You can then flask run to run the application locally on port 5000!


Our application is also hosted on Heroku at: fini-gs.herokuapp.com with our Heroku configuration in our Procfile!
